# How Does The Game Work

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X , the computer is O (or user is O and computer is X). Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
